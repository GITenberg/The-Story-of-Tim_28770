5</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The Russians have three grand popular tales, the subjects of
which are thievish adventures.&nbsp; One is called the <i>Story
of Klim</i>, another is called the <i>Story of Tim</i>, and the
third is called the <i>Story of Tom</i>.&nbsp; Below we present a
translation of the <i>Story of Tim</i>.</p>
<p>That part of the tale in which Tim inquires of the drowsy
Archimandrite as to the person to whom the stolen pelisse is to
be awarded, differs in no material point from a portion of a tale
narrated in the Turkish story-book of the lady and the forty
vizirs.&nbsp; The concluding part, however, in which we are told
how Tim&rsquo;s comrades twice stole the pig from him, and how he
twice regained it, is essentially Russian, and is original.</p>
<h2><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>THE STORY OF TIM</h2>
<p>In a certain village there lived an old man who had lost
almost the whole of his hair, partly from age, and partly from
the friction of his fur cap, which he never laid aside, either by
day or night.&nbsp; He had a helpmeet as ancient as himself, but
who differed from him in having a hump.&nbsp; Our story, however,
does not relate to them, but to a son of theirs, called Timoney,
who was a sharp lad enough, but who had learnt nothing but to
play on the fife.&nbsp; The old man thinking that music, however
sweet, would never fill the belly, and that it was quite
impossible to live on an empty stomach, determined to have the
boy taught some trade, but <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>ere fixing on
what it should be, he deemed it expedient to consult his old
woman on the subject; and, accordingly, requested her opinion,
adding that he would wish to see the boy either a blacksmith, or
a tailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have him neither the one nor the other.&nbsp; The blacksmith by
always going amidst fire and soot is so begrimed that he looks
rather like a devil than a man.&nbsp; Would you make a monster of
him?&nbsp; As for a tailor&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny that
tailoring is a rare art, but sitting doubled up, in a little time
brings on a consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what would you make of him?&rdquo; cried the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make of him?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;why a goldsmith or
a painter, or something similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;how
much money one must lay down to have him bound either to a
goldsmith or a painter?&nbsp; <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Why he would
swallow up all we have, or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They disputed so long, that they almost came to blows.&nbsp;
The old woman had already armed herself with the fire-pan.&nbsp;
At last, however, they agreed to bind their son to the first
master they should meet, whatever his trade might be.&nbsp; So
the old man, taking with him the sum of ten roubles, which he
destined for the binding his son out as an apprentice, set out
leading Tim by the hand.&nbsp; It happened, that the first people
he met were two born brothers, who maintained themselves by
levying taxes on the highway, and besides being tax-gatherers
were expert tailors, using their needles so adroitly, that with a
stitch or two they could make for themselves a coat or mantle; in
plain language, they were robbers.</p>
<p>The old man, after saluting them, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you craftsmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;Oh, yes! and very skilful ones,&rdquo; replied the
highwaymen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may be your trade?&rdquo; inquired the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that to you?&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wish to give my son a trade,&rdquo; said the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we will take your son with pleasure,&rdquo; they
cried, &ldquo;and instruct him in what we understand
ourselves.&nbsp; As for our trade, we have particular reasons for
not telling you what it is.&nbsp; Know, however, that you will
never repent entrusting your son to our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what must I give you for your trouble, good
people?&rdquo; cried the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can hardly give us less than twenty
roubles,&rdquo; replied the craftsmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! where shall I get so much money?&rdquo; cried the
old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have but ten roubles in all the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;O, very well! hand them over,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take them, though they be only ten roubles; we
don&rsquo;t wish to higgle with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man gave them the money, and begging them to spare no
pains in teaching his son their trade, he trudged homeward.&nbsp;
Remembering, however, that it was necessary to know where they
dwelt, he turned back, and went along with them.&nbsp; After some
time, they came to a house in a great wood, where the thieves
lived with a young girl who was their sister.&nbsp; On their
arrival they took off from Tim his rough country craftan and
breeches, and clothed him in habiliments of the very best
quality, and regaled the old man with plenty of capital
wine.&nbsp; So the old man, after staying an hour or two, left
their dwelling quite happy and content.</p>
<p>As soon as it was night, the thieves thought that they would
give Tim his first lesson in their art, so arming him in the same
manner as they did <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>themselves, with a pike and a long
knife, they went out on the road.&nbsp; As soon as they were got
there, one of the masters said to the pupil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, now, any people were to attack us, what would
you do, Tim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; said he, grasping his
knife; &ldquo;with this I don&rsquo;t care a straw for a dozen
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be of service to you, no doubt, some time or
other,&rdquo; said the thieves; &ldquo;it will be best, however,
that your first essay be in something not quite so dangerous as
levying taxes on the highways generally is.&nbsp; We will go to
the neighbouring monastery, and break into the treasury of the
Archimandrite; we shall find there quite enough to enrich
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! just as you please,&rdquo; cried Timoney;
&ldquo;where the master goes the &rsquo;prentice
follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away they went, all three in high spirits.&nbsp; When they
came to the cloister, they flung an <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>iron hook
upon the roof of the treasure-room, and Tim climbing up by means
of a rope which was attached to it, at once gave proof that he
was anything but a dull pupil.&nbsp; In a trice a hole was made
in the roof&mdash;the chests in the treasury were broken
open&mdash;money-bags were piled up upon the floor, and then
flung down out of the treasury upon the ground, where they were
gathered up by Tim&rsquo;s comrades, and what had taken a long
series of years to acquire was in a few minutes lost to the
proprietor.&nbsp; All would have gone on in the smoothest manner
in the world, provided Tim had been anything of a fool.&nbsp; But
he knew perfectly well that his friends below would take all the
money by virtue of being his instructors, and would not give him
a share; he, therefore, took from out of a chest the cloak of the
Archimandrite, which was made of the choicest sable-skin, and
flung it out of the hole upon the <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>ground,
intending it for himself, but had no sooner done so, than one of
his masters took it up and put it on.&nbsp; Tim then, letting
himself down began to feel for the cloak upon the ground, for it
was very dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you groping for?&rdquo; said his masters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seeking for my cloak,&rdquo; answered Tim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by calling it yours?&rdquo; said
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have put it on myself.&nbsp; How should it
belong to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Tim, &ldquo;I took it for myself,
and not for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are your instructors,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;consequently whatever you take belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! no,&rdquo; cried he, with a loud voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I got the money for you, it is true, and no share of that
belongs to me, but the cloak is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, fool,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! if you talk in that manner,&rdquo; said Tim, <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;I will go and ask the Archimandrite, and the one
to whom he adjudges it shall have the cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how you&rsquo;ll go to work,&rdquo;
said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;only don&rsquo;t be
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, he went to the window of the cell in which the
Archimandrite and his servant slept, the latter a very lively
lad, and a great teller of pleasant stories.&nbsp; Tim peeping
in, perceived that the Archimandrite was asleep, and snoring like
a hedgehog, but the lad was awake.&nbsp; Tim tapped with his
finger against the window, whereupon the lad got up and looked
out.&nbsp; But before he could ask who was there, Tim seized him
by the ears with both his hands, dragged him out, and tying a
handkerchief over his mouth, delivered him to the custody of his
associates.&nbsp; Then climbing softly in at the window, he lay
down in the young fellow&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; After waiting a
little time, he fell to arousing <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the
Archimandrite.&nbsp; His masters who were listening under the
window, hearing him try to awake the ghostly man, begged him to
come out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you about?&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
devil take you and the cloak, too!&nbsp; Woe is us, that we ever
came here with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But without attending to them, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Archimandrite! your reverence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! what!&rdquo; replied the Archimandrite, in a voice
half-suffocated with sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a very bad dream,&rdquo; said Tim, &ldquo;I
dreamt that thieves broke into the treasure-room, and carried
away all the money, and also your cloak of sable.&nbsp; He who
climbed up to steal the treasure, took the cloak out of the box,
intending it for himself.&nbsp; He gave his comrades all the
money, and only wanted to keep the cloak; but they refused to
give it him.&nbsp; Now, who do you say should have the
cloak?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The Archimandrite imagining that it was his chamberlain
who was speaking to him, cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how tiresome you are!&nbsp; People are sure to
dream at night.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t trouble my
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim was silent for a time, but no sooner had the Archimandrite
fallen asleep again, than he again awoke him, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom is the cloak to be given to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you tiresome fellow!&rdquo; cried the
Archimandrite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if you must know, I would have
it given to him who broke in.&nbsp; But, pray, let me
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim troubled him no more, and as soon as he was fast asleep
got out of the window and took possession of the cloak without
any opposition from his teachers, who extolled his cleverness to
the skies.&nbsp; They set out for home, and the first thing they
did when they arrived was to hide their booty.&nbsp; After this
adventure, Tim&rsquo;s <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>masters frequently discoursed with
each other about their apprentice.&nbsp; His address and
cleverness pleased them exceedingly.&nbsp; They hoped that he
would be of the greatest assistance to them, and in order to keep
him with them, they determined to give him their sister, who was
rather a pretty girl.&nbsp; When they declared their mind to Tim,
he was far from refusing so good a match, for they offered plenty
of money with her.&nbsp; So he married, and ceasing to be their
apprentice, became their brother-in-law and comrade.</p>
<p>After some time his wife said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad living with these brothers of mine who are
thieves to the very bone.&nbsp; Moreover, you know the rhyme,
&lsquo;Though the thief may thrive for many a day, he becomes at
last the hangman&rsquo;s prey.&rsquo;&nbsp; So it is my wish and
counsel that we separate from them at once and for ever, and go
and live at your father&rsquo;s house, <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>where, though
we may not be so rich, we shall at any rate be in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim approved of what she said, and communicated his intention
to those honest gentlemen&mdash;his brothers-in-law.&nbsp; They
were very much mortified at what he told them, and endeavoured to
persuade him to stay with them, but in vain.&nbsp; At last they
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let you go on the following conditions: we will
give you a swine, and if to-night we contrive to steal it from
you, you shall pay us two hundred roubles, or remain in our
service till you have gained for us that amount, and if we are
unable to steal the swine, we will pay the same sum to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Tim, &ldquo;I will see whether
you can steal her away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he loaded a cart with his property, and set off with his
wife to the house of his father.</p>
<p>As soon as he got home he mixed up in the <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>trough a mess
of barley-meal and wine for the pig, who, after gorging herself
with it, became senselessly drunk.&nbsp; Tim, then, dressing her
in a sarafan or woman&rsquo;s long night-gown, placed her on the
petsch or stove in a corner, where she stretched herself out and
lay without motion.&nbsp; He then went to bed with his wife in
the chamber above.&nbsp; They were scarcely asleep when the
thieves arrived, and searched in every nook and corner round
about the house, but not finding what they were in quest of, they
repaired to the kitchen, and, listening, heard something
snoring.&nbsp; Forthwith one of them crept in, and moving about
softly touched the swine, but feeling the nightgown at the same
time, he jumped out of the kitchen almost frightened out of his
wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; cried his comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I got
into such a scrape.&nbsp; The thing which is snoring in <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the
kitchen is the old beldame, Tim&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; I took hold
of her by the side, but so softly that I did not wake her, and
such a stench came from her that I really thought I should have
fainted.&nbsp; Now, what to do I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but,
stay!&nbsp; I will go and ask my sister where the swine is.&nbsp;
Perhaps she will tell me whilst she is dozing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then climbed softly on the top of the chamber, removed a board
from the roof, and, poking his sister gently with his stick,
said: &ldquo;Wife! where did we put the sow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that
we placed her in the kitchen, on the petsch, dressed in a
nightgown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner did the thief hear this than he sprang like a madman
from the roof, and rushing into the kitchen, dragged off from the
petsch the drunken swine.&nbsp; He and his brother then lugged
her away from the house, and when they had got to some distance,
they tied her feet <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>together, and thrusting a stick
under, they carried her off on their shoulders at full
trot.&nbsp; This riding on a stick&mdash;which was very different
from lying in a cradle&mdash;soon brought the sow to her senses,
who began to behave in a very obstreperous and disagreeable
manner, and the faster they went the more obstreperous and
disagreeable did she become.&nbsp; The thieves now began to
repent of the expedient which they had devised for bringing back
Tim to their society; but, fearing to lose two hundred roubles,
they bore all the nuisance of the swine, and hastened on their
way.</p>
<p>Tim awoke a little time after the swine had been carried away,
and being quite drowsy clean forgot what he had done with
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife! wife!&rdquo; cried he, jogging his bedfellow on
the side with his elbow, &ldquo;where did we hide the
swine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;since you asked
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>me that?&nbsp; Did I not tell you that she lies on the
petsch in the night-gown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you tell me that?&rdquo; cried he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long ago,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but no doubt you
were drowsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, farewell to our swine!&rdquo; said Tim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No doubt they have taken her away.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
springing from the bed he ran into the kitchen, but found no
swine upon the petsch.&nbsp; Tim felt his knees quake under
him.&nbsp; But the prospect of living with the thieves, as their
slave, compelled him to cast aside all useless despondency, and
to seek a remedy for the misfortune.&nbsp; Flinging himself upon
his horse he galloped off in the hope of overtaking the
travelling swine, in which he succeeded.&nbsp; He came up with
the party just as they were entering the wood, and rode gently
after them; the night, which was exceedingly dark, preventing the
thieves from seeing him.&nbsp; By this time they were excessively
weary, and <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>wishing to take some rest, they flung
the swine upon the ground in a rage, and one of them said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a weight!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enough to kill
one.&nbsp; Yet one must not mind toiling when two hundred roubles
are at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth the other: &ldquo;I would almost give up the roubles for
a horse or something to carry this load of carrion for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tim, leading his horse some way aside, tied it to a
tree, then drawing softly nigh he began to make a jingling with
the bridle and stirrups which he had taken off the horse.&nbsp;
One of the thieves hearing the jingling said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, brother! some horse is going about entangled in
its harness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tim still continued jingling, one of them fully persuaded
that there was a horse close at hand set off to catch it, whilst
the other rested himself sitting close by the swine.&nbsp; Tim
moved <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>on before the thief, who followed,
expecting every moment to lay his hand upon the strayed
horse.&nbsp; Imperceptibly he led him to a great distance, and
then leaving him hurried back to the other.&nbsp; When he was not
more than twenty yards from him he stopped and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, brother, come and help me to untie this accursed
brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow, imagining that it was his brother, got up to help
him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty baby you, who cannot untie a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim, however, pretending that he could not hold the horse,
moved away, and led him very far from the road.&nbsp; Then
leaving him to seek his brother who was in vain pursuit of the
horse he ran to where the swine lay, and, seizing hold of her,
placed her upon his horse and carried her off.&nbsp; As soon as
he got home he tied her by the leg to the hand-mill which stood
in the <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>middle of the kitchen, round which he
strewed a quantity of rye.&nbsp; Forthwith the swine fell to
eating the rye, and, by moving round, set the mill a
grinding.&nbsp; Tim then flung himself upon his bed, and without
any care resigned himself to sleep.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the thieves met each other.</p>
<p>One said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other answered, that he had never caught a glimpse of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you call me to help you to untie
it?&rdquo; said the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;I never
spoke a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said his comrade, &ldquo;it is plain
that fellow Tim has played us a trick.&nbsp; Let us go and see
whether the swine is where we left her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, after seeking her for a long time in vain, they concluded
that their brother-in-law had <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>carried her
back with him home, whereupon they set off for Tim&rsquo;s house
with all speed.</p>
<p>On arriving at the court-yard, they went to the kitchen, and
one of them said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, I am afraid we have lost our two hundred
roubles.&nbsp; The old beldame, Tim&rsquo;s mother, is awake and
up.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you hear her getting the mill in
order?&nbsp; She is going to grind.&nbsp; However, I will go to
my sister, and ask her, as I did before, where the swine is hid;
perhaps it is not in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he climbed up upon the roof as he had done before, and
waking his sister said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, where is the swine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be asleep,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;have you
forgotten that she is tied to the hand-mill in the
kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief, having learnt where the swine was, ran to the
kitchen, and seizing his booty hastened away with his brother,
saying:</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Master Tim has taught us a lesson; he will not
deceive us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this Tim awoke, and jumping up, ran to look
after the swine.&nbsp; But on entering the kitchen, he perceived
that she had been stolen a second time.&nbsp; Nothing now
remained for him to do but to run and overtake the thieves, and
discover some means of deceiving them again.&nbsp; He ran without
any burden on his back, and besides, was all the fresher for
having rested, consequently he had no difficulty in overtaking
the tired thieves, who were carrying the swine between
them.&nbsp; He went softly behind them till they came to the
wood.</p>
<p>As soon as they had entered it one of the thieves said to his
comrade:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us rest awhile here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother; if Tim overtakes us here, he will trick us
again by some means or other.&nbsp; <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>But some way
farther on you remember there is an empty cottage, near the road,
there we can rest without danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said his comrade, &ldquo;we will stop
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim, hearing what they said, turned aside, and, getting before
them, daubed his face with clay; then, running as fast as he
could to the cottage, he sat down within the ruined petsch,
holding in his hand a brick.&nbsp; He had not waited five minutes
when they entered the cottage and cast the swine down upon the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, brother,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;we have nearly
finished the business, let us smoke a pipe of tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; replied the other, taking out his flint
and steel; but though he struck and struck, he could not make the
tinder take light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty
affair,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the tinder got <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>damp as I ran
amidst the dew of the wood endeavouring to overtake that rascal
Tim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the mouth of the petsch,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;perhaps a spark will take hold of the soot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other went up to the petsch and began again to
strike.&nbsp; In the meantime Tim, looking full at him, gnashed
his teeth violently.&nbsp; The thief, hearing something gnashing,
struck harder than before, and, looking into the petsch by the
light of the sparks, instantly fell to the ground, for seeing the
face of Tim he took him for the devil and was so terrified that
he could only utter with a broken voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother!&mdash;the devil!&mdash;the
devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, Tim knocked violently upon the petsch, and hurled
the brick at the other thief, who made for the door, but,
striking his forehead against the lintel, he fell
senseless.&nbsp; Tim then seizing one of their sticks began to
belabour his <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>brothers-in-law so lustily that they
soon recovered their recollection and betook themselves to
flight.&nbsp; Their legs trembled so with the fright they were in
that they stumbled more than once; but Tim assisted them on their
way by pelting them with bricks.&nbsp; Having driven them off, he
took the swine and carried her home, where he arrived just as the
day was beginning to break.</p>
<p>The first word which the thieves said on recovering their
breath was about the wager with their brother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;as the devil has run away
with the swine, Tim cannot produce her, so we will force him to
come and live with us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon they set off straight for the house, because it was
already getting light; but on their arrival they found that they
had lost their wager, and that it was not the devil who had <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>routed them in the deserted cottage, but their
brother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you precious rascal!&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;you
nearly killed us with terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help, brothers,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;you were thinking of taking two hundred roubles from me,
but now you have to pay them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some demur, he received the money from them, and began
to live in a highly respectable manner.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
